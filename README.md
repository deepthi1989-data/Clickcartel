Project Title: E-commerce User Behavior Analytics Pipeline

1. Project Context and Scenario
You are a Data Engineer at "ClickCartel," a rapidly growing e-commerce platform. The marketing and product teams are struggling to make data-driven decisions because their raw user data is disconnected and hard to analyze. They have come to you with a critical business need:

"We need to understand our user journey. What products are people looking at? What actions lead to a purchase? Who are our most valuable customers? We need reliable, aggregated data to answer these questions."

Your mission is to take on this request and build an automated, scalable data pipeline. You will process raw, messy user event data, combine it with customer and product information, and produce clean, aggregated "Gold" tables ready for the analytics team. This pipeline will be the single source of truth for user behavior analytics at ClickCartel.
